    <p>Hello!</p>
    <p>My name is Shelby, and I'm currently majoring in Professional Studies. I initially wanted to go into hospitality and tourism <br>
       and did an internship in Japan to gain experience in that field. That was when I discovered what I thought I wanted to study <br>
       wasn't something I enjoyed, and it's also where I started to get into coding on my own. A close friend who often kept me company<br>
       while I was overseas helped me get into it and would code with me in my free time. Once I realized how much I enjoyed coding, <br> 
       it created a shift in my education path, and here I am!</p>
    <p>I currently work full-time as a TA at an ER for animals, primarily dogs and cats are what we treat. While I do enjoy the job, <br>
       I've officially come to fully realize what career path and future I'd like to persue and support. Once I complete my schooling,<br> 
       I hope to transition into a job in the tech field, and fully grow there.</p>
